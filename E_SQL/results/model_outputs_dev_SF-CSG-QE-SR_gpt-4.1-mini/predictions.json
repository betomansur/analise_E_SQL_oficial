To answer the question, we need to identify molecules labeled as carcinogenic (molecule.label = '+') and count the bonds of type single bond (bond.bond_type = '-').

Both tables are linked by the school identifier, cds in satscores and CDSCode in frpm. To answer the question, we need to join satscores and frpm on cds = CDSCode, filter schools where NumTstTakr is not zero to avoid division by zero, and where the excellence rate (NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) is greater than 0.3. Then, for these schools, calculate the eligible free rate (Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17) / Enrollment (Ages 5-17)) ensuring Enrollment (Ages 5-17) is not zero to avoid division by zero. Finally, select the maximum eligible free rate among these schools. This detailed understanding links the question to the relevant tables (satscores, frpm), columns (NumGE1500, NumTstTakr, Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17), Enrollment (Ages 5-17)), and conditions (NumTstTakr != 0, Enrollment (Ages 5-17) != 0, excellence rate > 0.3).
